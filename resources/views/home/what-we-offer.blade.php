                        <p>Our work would not be possible without you: global citizens who want to make positive,

                            We partner with corporations, foundations, individual philanthropists, school groups, and
                            more, connecting our donors to communities and children who would otherwise be overlooked.
                            Whether you’re are an executive looking to boost your company’s social responsibility
                            efforts, or a grandmother wanting to make a special gift in a child’s honor; we’re here to
                            help you make a difference in the world. On behalf of the millions of children that’ll be

                            opportunities in society and live free from violence, discrimination, and exploitation. To
                            that end, Blueglide capital invests in innovative local organizations, helping them deepen
                            their impact and build their capacity for social change. Together Blueglide Capital and its
                            partners advance the rights of children and youth facing poverty and injustice and equip

                        <p>This one belief guides us in everything we do at Blueglide Capital. It inspires us to grant
                            life-changing wishes for children going through so much. It compels us to be creative in
                            exceeding the expectations of every kid. It drives us to make our donated resources go as
                            far as possible. Most of all, it's the founding principle of our vision to grant the wish of
                            every eligible child, Wishes are more than just a nice thing. And they are far more than
                            gifts, or singular events in time.Your donations impact everyone involved- kids, volunteers,
                            donors, sponsors, medical professionals and communities. For kids, just the act of making
                            their wish and dreams come true can give them the courage to comply with their medical
                            treatments. Parents might finally feel like they can be optimistic. And still others might
                            realize all they have to offer the world through volunteer work or philanthropy.

                            kids need hope more than ever because many of their dreams and wishes have been delayed,
                            they're having to wait even longer. But you can help! Making a donation can grant even more
                            waiting wishes as soon as we're able. Join our Messages of Hope movement to provide hope and
                            encouragement to kids during this difficult time. For children diagnosed with critical
                            illnesses, a wish come true can be a crucial turning point in their lives. A wish can be
                            that spark that helps these children believe that anything is possible and gives them the
                            strength to fight harder against their illnesses. This impact is why we are driven to make
                            every one of these wishes come true.</p>

                                <p>
									Monetarytrades believes portfolio management is far more than just buying stocks and bonds and hoping they do well. We use a tested “top-down” investment approach combined with personalized planning to build a portfolio tailored to your long-term financial goals. Our proven approach has attracted a global base of over 900 million individual and institutional clients.
                                </p>
								<p>
									We want to improve the financial well-being of our clients, beyond just recommending an investment strategy. We stay in touch as your needs evolve and market conditions shift. We help you meet your longer-term goals with an investment strategy that’s specifically designed for you. And we’re transparent about the investing decisions we make for you because we believe an informed investor is a better investor and a happier client.
								</p>
								<p>
									Much like a tailor who alters the hem, sleeves, and collar of a suit to fit an individual's proportions, we take a variety of factors into account to create a portfolio tailored to your needs. Some of the factors we may consider when choosing the optimal long-term investment strategy and near-term portfolio tactics include: investment Goals, Tax consideration and Income needs. Our dedicated Portfolio Evaluation Group, under the guidance of our Investment Policy Committee, will use this information to provide you with a written personalized portfolio analysis and investment strategy recommendation. As your circumstances change, your portfolio needs may too. Your personal Investment Counselor will regularly review your individual situation with you and keep you abreast of our views on capital markets and important developments related to your portfolio.
								</p>
                                <h1 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">Financial Planning</h1>
								<p>
									We can help you prepare for the future with a financial plan designed especially for you. A good financial plan is a blueprint that lets you save, spend, invest, manage risk and approach tax and estate planning with confidence.
								</p>
								<br>
                                <h4 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">Assessing Your Financial Plans</h4>
								<p>1) Does your financial plan provide an investment strategy to help you reach your financial goals and objectives?</p>
								<p>
									The overall success of your financial plan is partly dependent on an appropriate investment recommendation, based on your long-term financial goals and objectives. At Blueglide Capital, we take into account everything from your family health history to the specific stocks, bonds or other investments in your portfolio to help build an in-depth understanding of the objectives for your assets. Using tools like portfolio simulations and historical modeling, we can provide an investment recommendation we believe is most likely to help you reach your goals. This recommendation provides the foundation for your future financial success, and may help you avoid running out of money in retirement.
								</p>

								<p>
									2) Is your financial plan helping to ensure you leave the legacy you want?
								</p>
								<p>
									Many investors find their investment time horizon may last beyond their lifetime, giving them the opportunity to use their assets to support someone or something important to them. While supplementary to an appropriate investment recommendation, planning for and protecting the future of your wealth are common needs that can be complicated to address. At Monetarytrades, we can provide perspective on tactics and resources available to help ensure what you want to happen, does.
								</p>
								<p>
									3) Does your financial plan provide perspective on financial planning topics such as Social Security, taxes and insurance?
								</p>
								<p>
									Many investors want to feel they are making informed and prudent decisions about all aspects of their wealth, not just their investment strategy and legacy. Understanding the relationship between taxes, cash flow requirements, and Social Security benefits may influence how you meet your living expenses both before and after retirement. Additionally, recognizing the connection between your investments and insurance needs (e.g. health, long term care, and annuities) may help you decide whether purchasing coverage is appropriate.
