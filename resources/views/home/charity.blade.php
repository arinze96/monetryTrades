					<p>Our work would not be possible without you: global citizens who want to make positive, lasting change in children’s lives. We are grateful to each and every one of you.

						We partner with corporations, foundations, individual philanthropists, school groups, and more, connecting our donors to communities and children who would otherwise be overlooked. Whether you’re are an executive looking to boost your company’s social responsibility efforts, or a grandmother wanting to make a special gift in a child’s honor; we’re here to help you make a difference in the world. On behalf of the millions of children that’ll be impacted by your generosity – thank you.
						
						We partner to build a world where all children and youth enjoy equal resources and opportunities in society and live free from violence, discrimination, and exploitation. To that end, Blueglide capital invests in innovative local organizations, helping them deepen their impact and build their capacity for social change. Together Blueglide Capital and its partners advance the rights of children and youth facing poverty and injustice and equip them with the tools and skills to reach their full potential.</p>

					<p>This one belief guides us in everything we do at Blueglide Capital. It inspires us to grant life-changing wishes for children going through so much. It compels us to be creative in exceeding the expectations of every kid. It drives us to make our donated resources go as far as possible. Most of all, it's the founding principle of our vision to grant the wish of every eligible child, Wishes are more than just a nice thing. And they are far more than gifts, or singular events in time.Your donations impact everyone involved- kids, volunteers, donors, sponsors, medical professionals and communities. For kids, just the act of making their wish and dreams come true can give them the courage to comply with their medical treatments. Parents might finally feel like they can be optimistic. And still others might realize all they have to offer the world through volunteer work or philanthropy.

						kids need hope more than ever because many of their dreams and wishes have been delayed, they're having to wait even longer. But you can help! Making a donation can grant even more waiting wishes as soon as we're able. Join our Messages of Hope movement to provide hope and encouragement to kids during this difficult time. For children diagnosed with critical illnesses, a wish come true can be a crucial turning point in their lives. A wish can be that spark that helps these children believe that anything is possible and gives them the strength to fight harder against their illnesses. This impact is why we are driven to make every one of these wishes come true.</p>

									It is worthy of mention that in our bid to reach out to as many people as possible, especially traders, Prostackinvest joined the Facebook community two years ago to see how we can fully utilize the potentials of the Facebook marketing strategy. Ours is a business that does not only derive its strength from genuinely addressing market needs with a very high sense of sincerity and professionalism but also to manage traders funds reliably. Within one year of successful fund management services in the country, we extended our operations to the international market thereby attracting investor’s interest with increased subscription in line with global best practices.

								<p>In 2013, the founders of Prostackinvest went ahead to sponsor inventions and innovations. Till date, not only are the founding fund managers and active traders with IRek Wealth Investment operating under individual operations but this has been extended to an array of private funds. Our cumulative income from Assets Under Management (AUM) worth about USD 80m also grew within the range of USD 200 million in 2014. In our quest for expansion, we took our infrastructure to the retail market in 2015 where our complete institutional framework, liquidity, and clearance engine was leveraged on to provide the flow for the retail market.</p>

								<p>Before 2014, the founding fund managers and active traders of Prostackinvest sailed their separate ships before they finally merged to sail together and within one year, the founders of Master Trade Investments decided to implement collective structures. However, that same year, while fund management services were still offered for public subscription, the founders put an end to multiple funds offerings to the public and in place, introduced a single closed fund with a private company with the aim of ensuring discreet fund management practices, thereby reducing opportunities for commercialization by various providers.</p>

								<p>The new site for Prostackinvest was also launched with white, blue, and grey as primary colors. Apart from complementing each other, the colors also have great symbolism. While the white color symbolized purity and transparency which is a symbolism of our transparency in business transactions, customer support and payout procedures, the blue color represents an appealing uniqueness personifying trading. The grey color stands for the wisdom applied towards achieving positive results from our successful trade. The choice of these friendly colors were informed by our firm believe that our customers deserve to be comfortable with doing business with us. Prostackinvest has software it regularly uses for examination as a way of measuring client’s satisfaction from services rendered. Our company has maintained a 98% satisfaction rating among its short-term and long-term clients. In the Canada, Prostackinvest remains a part of the Investors Compensation Fund (ICF) and is a signatory in Europe.</p>
