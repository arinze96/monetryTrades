                        <p>Our work would not be possible without you: global citizens who want to make positive,
                            lasting change in children’s lives. We are grateful to each and every one of you.

                            We partner with corporations, foundations, individual philanthropists, school groups, and
                            more, connecting our donors to communities and children who would otherwise be overlooked.
                            Whether you’re are an executive looking to boost your company’s social responsibility
                            efforts, or a grandmother wanting to make a special gift in a child’s honor; we’re here to
                            help you make a difference in the world. On behalf of the millions of children that’ll be
                            impacted by your generosity – thank you.

                            We partner to build a world where all children and youth enjoy equal resources and
                            opportunities in society and live free from violence, discrimination, and exploitation. To
                            that end, monetarytrades invests in innovative local organizations, helping them deepen
                            their impact and build their capacity for social change. Together monetarytrades and its
                            partners advance the rights of children and youth facing poverty and injustice and equip
                            them with the tools and skills to reach their full potential.</p>

                        <p>This one belief guides us in everything we do at Monetary Trades. It inspires us to grant
                            life-changing wishes for children going through so much. It compels us to be creative in
                            exceeding the expectations of every kid. It drives us to make our donated resources go as
                            far as possible. Most of all, it's the founding principle of our vision to grant the wish of
                            every eligible child, Wishes are more than just a nice thing. And they are far more than
                            gifts, or singular events in time.Your donations impact everyone involved- kids, volunteers,
                            donors, sponsors, medical professionals and communities. For kids, just the act of making
                            their wish and dreams come true can give them the courage to comply with their medical
                            treatments. Parents might finally feel like they can be optimistic. And still others might
                            realize all they have to offer the world through volunteer work or philanthropy.

                            kids need hope more than ever because many of their dreams and wishes have been delayed,
                            they're having to wait even longer. But you can help! Making a donation can grant even more
                            waiting wishes as soon as we're able. Join our Messages of Hope movement to provide hope and
                            encouragement to kids during this difficult time. For children diagnosed with critical
                            illnesses, a wish come true can be a crucial turning point in their lives. A wish can be
                            that spark that helps these children believe that anything is possible and gives them the
                            strength to fight harder against their illnesses. This impact is why we are driven to make
                            every one of these wishes come true.</p>

                                <p>When there’s an opportunity to spark big change, we’re willing to take smart risks
                                    that others won’t. We recognize that social innovation requires thinking big and
                                    breaking down barriers, so we strive to be courageous but not single-minded,
                                    visionary but rooted in real progress.</p>

                                    failure, trying again, and encouraging others to do the same.</p>

                                    build movements of social change.</p>

                                <h1 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">Safeguarding Policy</h1>
                                <p>MONETARY TRADES’s donation for Children partners with community-based organizations
                                    around the world to help children and youth reach their full potential and advance
                                    their rights. We are deeply committed to protecting those most at risk and to acting
                                    as a role model for child- and youth-serving organizations.

                                    Although children and youth may be extremely resourceful and resilient, they are
                                    also particularly vulnerable to abuse due to their lack of status and power, their
                                    stage of development, and their reliance on adults.</p>

                                <p>We recognize that: <br>

                                    Organizations and professionals working or in contact with children and youth have a
                                    duty to ensure safety and wellbeing. <br>
                                    The welfare of the child is a paramount consideration, as enshrined in the UN
                                    Convention on the Rights of the Child. <br>
                                    All children and youth have an equal right to protection, regardless of age,
                                    disability, gender, racial heritage, religious belief, sexual orientation, or gender
                                    identity. <br>
                                    It is our responsibility to minimize the harm that may be done as a result of our
                                    activities. <br>
                                    Our Global Safeguarding Policy reflects our commitment to respect, promote, uphold,
                                    and protect the rights of the child as set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of
                                    the Child and in line with Monetary Trades values.</p>

                                <h1 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">OUR VISION</h1>
                                Our vision is that every child and young person has a safe and happy childhood, and the
                                foundations they need to thrive. We do this by working closely with children and their
                                families, from before they’re born until their twenties.
								
                                Our work is split into three main areas: To make sure our work helps the most vulnerable
                                children and young people, we're pressing for change on three key themes:
								
                                <h4 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">Best start in life</h4>
								<p>We know how important the early years are - and we’re here to help. From parenting advice to education and early intervention, we focus on improving children’s life chances.</p>
								
                                <h4 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">Good Mental Health;</h4>
								<p>there's an increasing crisis in mental health among children and young people, with many are not getting the help they need.  Everyone has ups and downs in life. Our mental and emotional well-being experts work with families and schools to make sure children and parents feel able to cope with challenges when they arise.</p>
                                <h4 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">A safe and loving home;</h4>
								<p>We make sure more children feel part of a family that cares for them. We find homes for those without, protect children who have been abused or neglected, and help ensure young carers don’t miss out on childhood, and provide support to disabled children and their families, while children at risk often only get help when they've hit crisis point. Many in care, especially teenagers, face placement instability. 

									Many children and young people who have experienced domestic abuse do not get the support they need. How we help children and young people growing up is full of challenges but with a united effort we offer guidance, practical and emotional support. We do this in lots of different ways.</p>

									<p>Early years education that helps babies and toddlers learn and grow. <br> <br>
										Protection from neglect and abuse, and help so that children can overcome past experiences. <br> <br>
										Foster, adoption and residential services that provide safe, loving family homes. <br> <br>
										Support for disabled young people, which builds confidence and independence. <br> <br>
										Tackling mental health issues in children and young people. <br> <br>
										Positive conversations about mental health, including The Blues Programme, our emotional wellbeing course for teenagers. <br> <br>
										Giving young carers a break, so they can enjoy just being a child. <br> <br>
										Employability and life skills programmes that prepare young people for their life as adults. <br> <br>
										Campaigning so the voices of children and young people are heard. <br> <br>
										Provide for critically ill children especially cancer affected children.</p> <br>
										
										<h1 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">OUR IMPACT</h1>
										<p>
											Right now, Monetary Trades is helping the most vulnerable children across the Globe, We work to change the lives of vulnerable children starting at an early age. We’ve been doing this for about 3years. We’ve learnt a lot in this time - gathering experience and expertise that we use every day in more than 475 local services, in schools, and online. We make a real difference by doing what’s proven to work, and by coming up with new solutions. Last year, we reached 387,000 children, young people and families across the globe.
											
											We make sure children get the best start in life. Our foster, adoption and modern residential services find children a loving home. We protect those who have been abused or neglected, and help children who care for others or find themselves homeless. Projects like the Blues Programme give young people the tools to look after their mental and emotional wellbeing.
											
											We make an impact in so many ways. Here’s some of the ways we helped children, young people and families last year:
										</p>
										<h4 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">13,500</h4>
										<p>The number of children we supported through nurseries, out-of-school clubs, children’s centres, family centres and playgroups. That’s parenting programmes, ante-natal support and breastfeeding advice; drop-in groups. Plus specialised help to address or prevent problems that may arise in the first years of a child’s life.</p>
										<h4 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">8,000</h4>
										<p>The number of children and young people we helped to find a stable and loving home. We’ve protected them from domestic violence, self-harm and suicide; built warm and supportive relationships with parents and carers; and helped them develop social skills and friendships. We’ve kept families together, or made sure children are cared for through fostering and adoption.</p>

										<h4 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">11,000</h4>
										<p>The number of children we’ve helped to improve their mental health in 2017/18. We’ve given support to young people who care for a family member, helped build practical life skills and friendships, turned around the lives of those who have committed a crime. Seventy-seven per cent of young people who took part in our enhanced Programme showed an improvement in their mental health and wellbeing. We’ve also provided medical support to critically ill children suffering from cancer,heart problems and other severe ailments,we provide these kids with the best medical attention ranging from medical surgeries,to drug procurement and provision of essential needs..</p>

										<h1 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">Where your money goes</h1>
										<p>In 2018/19, your donations helped us reach more than 387,000 children, young people and families across the globe

											Money raised by our incredible supporters – people like you – means we can protect and support more vulnerable and less privileged children
											
											For every $1 we spend, it goes directly towards helping children, young people and their families, and – with rising levels of poverty, abuse and neglect – this is vital.
											
											We step in early to stop abuse and neglect, find loving foster and adoptive homes, support young carers, and help young people out of trouble and into education and employment.</p>
