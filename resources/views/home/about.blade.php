                            lasting change in children’s lives. We are grateful to each and every one of you.

                            We partner with corporations, foundations, individual philanthropists, school groups, and
                            more, connecting our donors to communities and children who would otherwise be overlooked.
                            Whether you’re are an executive looking to boost your company’s social responsibility
                            efforts, or a grandmother wanting to make a special gift in a child’s honor; we’re here to
                            help you make a difference in the world. On behalf of the millions of children that’ll be

                            opportunities in society and live free from violence, discrimination, and exploitation. To
                            that end, Blueglide capital invests in innovative local organizations, helping them deepen
                            their impact and build their capacity for social change. Together Blueglide Capital and its
                            partners advance the rights of children and youth facing poverty and injustice and equip

                        <p>This one belief guides us in everything we do at Blueglide Capital. It inspires us to grant
                            life-changing wishes for children going through so much. It compels us to be creative in
                            exceeding the expectations of every kid. It drives us to make our donated resources go as
                            far as possible. Most of all, it's the founding principle of our vision to grant the wish of
                            every eligible child, Wishes are more than just a nice thing. And they are far more than
                            gifts, or singular events in time.Your donations impact everyone involved- kids, volunteers,
                            donors, sponsors, medical professionals and communities. For kids, just the act of making
                            their wish and dreams come true can give them the courage to comply with their medical
                            treatments. Parents might finally feel like they can be optimistic. And still others might
                            realize all they have to offer the world through volunteer work or philanthropy.

                            kids need hope more than ever because many of their dreams and wishes have been delayed,
                            they're having to wait even longer. But you can help! Making a donation can grant even more
                            waiting wishes as soon as we're able. Join our Messages of Hope movement to provide hope and
                            encouragement to kids during this difficult time. For children diagnosed with critical
                            illnesses, a wish come true can be a crucial turning point in their lives. A wish can be
                            that spark that helps these children believe that anything is possible and gives them the
                            strength to fight harder against their illnesses. This impact is why we are driven to make
                            every one of these wishes come true.</p>

                                <h1 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">Our Approach</h1>
                                <h4 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">We Actively Monitor Markets</h4>
                                <p>Our experienced analysts continuously monitor capital markets on a global scale,
                                    keeping an eye on market conditions, economic developments, and political issues.
                                    This information guides the portfolio management process in both identifying
                                    opportunities and recognizing risk factors. We summarize this information for
                                    clients through a variety of communications, keeping you apprised of our market
                                    thinking and what’s happening inside your portfolio.</p>

                                <h4 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">A Top-Down Investment Approach</h4>
                                <p>Two common approaches to investment portfolio construction are bottom up investing
                                    and top-down investing. A bottom-up investing approach is essentially a
                                    stock-picking method where you focus on individual security selection rather than a
                                    portfolio’s allocation to various countries, company-sizes, security types or other
                                    characteristics.

                                    However, we prefer a top-down investing approach. This method emphasizes broader
                                    economic factors. The strategy determines the allocation and selection of assets
                                    based on macroeconomic characteristics and how they expect to affect different areas
                                    of the market. Once the investors have identified the areas they think will perform
                                    well, they can select individual securities within those areas.</p>

                                <h1 style="font-style:italics; color:#0f1341">Flexible strategy</h1>
                                <p>Many investment managers and funds specialize in particular areas of the market. They
                                    might invest in only US stocks, high-yield bonds or even more specific areas of the
                                    market, like small-cap growth stocks. A snapshot of their performance at any given
                                    moment might seem impressive. But what happens when their narrowly focused
                                    investment strategy falls out of favor?</p>
                                <p>In our experience, no single strategy is always superior, and those who adopt such an
                                    approach can underperform as leadership styles continually rotate. At Montary
                                    Trades, we use an active investment approach, led by our Investment Policy Committee
                                    and in-house Research department, that helps us respond to market shifts and their
                                    impact in clients portfolios. Monetarytrades employs a large team of investment
                                    professionals who analyze regions, countries, sectors and industries When managing
                                    investments for our clients, we believe this comprehensive approach to research
                                    allows us to invest across a variety of areas in the market, using a flexible
                                    strategy designed to help capture potential opportunities for our clients consistent
                                    with their goals and objectives.</p>
                                <p>Our active investing strategy is based upon our forward-looking view of markets. We
                                    make tactical adjustments along the way, moving clients’ portfolios into the types
                                    of stocks and bonds we expect to perform best. A portfolio that provides zero
                                    exposure to almost half of developed world equity markets is the opposite of
                                    diversified. But many investors portfolios might be doing just that if their
                                    investment firm only focuses on US companies and ignores the 40%+ of international
                                    developed-world equity markets. Such investors lack exposure to foreign markets
                                    whose stocks often trade leadership with US stocks, which can help reduce overall
                                    portfolio volatility. At Monetarytrades, we set ourselves apart by approaching asset
                                    management from a global perspective. We invest globally to help hedge against
                                    domestic downturns, expose portfolios to more opportunities, diversify and, over
                                    time, reduce volatility.</p>

                                <p>Unlike many money managers that sell cookie-cutter portfolios, we tailor portfolios

                                    investment products and earns no commissions on trades. We simply charge a
                                    management fee based on the size of your account, so we do better when you do
                                    better. Furthermore, you will have a dedicated Investment Counselor who calls
                                    regularly to keep you informed (not because we have something to sell).</p>
