                                <p>
                                    Maintaining high-efficiency management of assets requires the framework of acceptable risks to be defined and applied to the operations of both QA algorithmic complex and manual trading department.
                                </p>
								<p>
                                    All the funds used in active trading turnover are distributed across sub-accounts. The volume of assets put under the management of different QA algorithmic complex robots and traders is carried out by evaluating core KPIs on assets management's efficiency.
								</p>
								<p>
                                    Monetarytrades uses its own proprietary software systems to remotely manage and monitor trading strategies across all the sub-accounts and blocks any operations with cryptocurrency assets in critical circumstances. This solution allows the chief risk manager and the risk management team to execute quick and efficient decisions on trading permits and limits for the entire trading system of the fund ensuring the strict compliance with risk management protocols at any time.
