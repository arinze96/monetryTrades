                                        Monetarytrades accepts funds from its customers and creates consolidated financial flows of investment funds, carefully analyzing all aspects that may affect the conclusion of a particular exchange transaction. Making a profit, we divide it between clients in accordance with a fixed percentage of profitability, and use the remaining profit directly at our discretion.

                                        We are trying to look at the business as wide as possible. But at the same time, we are committed to the narrow specialization of our own traders, who focus their efforts on narrow trading sectors. Combining these approaches, we balance and effectively pursue our online trading strategy.

                                        Using the earned profit as the main financial instrument, we are constantly progressing and increasing our presence in the online trading market. Also, we constantly invest in the development of new business areas.
